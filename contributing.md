# How to Contribute

We're still working out the kinks to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, but we're not quite there yet. Hopefully this document makes the process for contributing clear and answers some questions that you may have.

## [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/15927506127/mySuggestion/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md)

I has adopted a Code of Conduct that we expect project participants to adhere to. Please read [the full text](https://github.com/15927506127/mySuggestion/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md) so that you can understand what actions will and will not be tolerated.

## Open Development

All work on Jest happens directly on [GitHub](https://github.com/15927506127/mySuggestion/blob/master). Both core team members and external contributors send pull requests which go through the same review process.

### `master` is unsafe

We will do our best to keep `master` in good shape, with tests passing at all times. But in order to move fast, we will make API changes that your application might not be compatible with. We will do our best to communicate these changes and always version appropriately so you can lock into a specific version if need be.

### Workflow and Pull Requests

The core team will be monitoring for pull requests.

*Before* submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is doneâ€¦

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. Make sure you have a compatible version of `node` installed

## Bugs

### Where to Find Known Issues

We will be using GitHub Issues for our public bugs. We will keep a close eye on this and try to make it clear when we have an internal fix in progress. Before filing a new issue, try to make sure your problem doesn't already exist.

### Reporting New Issues

The best way to get your bug fixed is to provide a reduced test case. Please provide a public repository with a runnable example.
